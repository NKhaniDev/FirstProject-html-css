                The results of the implemented Ls-Dyna SPH model were compared to experimental data. The defined validation criteria were the cutting forces. This study shows the relevance of the selected numerical tool. The SPH model is capable of predicting continuous and shears localized chips and all the steps of its formation. The model also correctly estimates the cutting forces approximately 19%, 22%  and 11% errors on  x, y and z components, respectively) without introducing an adjusting parameter like Coulomb friction. Thus, comparable results to machining dedicated codes are obtained. The SPH model advantages are the total transparency of the assumptions made and the use of no adjusted numerical parameter (friction coefficient, fracture control parameter). Another important aspect is the meshless nature of the SPH. Indeed, no remeshing is needed to deal with high transformations problems and a ‘‘natural’’ workpiece/chip separation is thus possible.
